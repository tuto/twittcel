In a conversation appeared concern 
<h2>
Â¿how many twitters are in Chile and how they are divided by commune? 
</h2>

Thus was born twittcel. 
<p>
The idea is to have an app that communicates with twitter from time to time and ask users for a certain geolocation, we store it in a db and combine it with information from the various districts of Chile. 
</p>
<p>
When you answer the twitter info gives you a user <strong>"Where is located" not "Where is"</strong> 
then what we do is parse the location of your bio and to match with the communes of Chile</p>

<p>
if you want to see in operation looks <a href = "http://dakoo.cl/twittcel" target = "_blank">here</a>
