In a conversation appeared concern 
<h2>
Â¿how many twitters are in Chile and how they are divided by commune? 
</h2>

Thus was born twittcel. The idea is to have an app that communicates with twitter from time to time and ask users for a certain geolocation, we store it in a db and combine it with information from the various districts of Chile. When you answer the twitter info gives you a user "Where is located" not "Where is" then what we do is parse the location of your bio and to match with the communes of Chile
